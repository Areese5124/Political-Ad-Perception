## About 
The Facebook Ad Data Project is a series of statistical models I created in 2024 as part of a final project for the class Datascience 161: Text as Data at the University of California San Diego. The databse I used comes from the [Ad Observer Project](https://adobserver.org/) by the [NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy](https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/) center. 

***As of 8/12/24 the data is not currently avliable publicly anymore.***

## Research Design of Project
The goal of the The Facebook Ad Data Project was to investigate what words or phrases in political advertisements are more likely to make an individual think that an ad they see online is a political ad? With this project I hoped to gain better insight into what concepts and words are perceived as political by the public. However their was a mistake in the research design when causing my models to null. 

## Standard Topic Modeling
For this project I used Structural Topic Modeling (STM) as my statistical model. Structural Topic Modeling is a type of topic modeling that concentrates on corpus structure through document-level covariates and how they affect topical prevalence and/or topical content. These models are then able to identify the underlying themes of the text based on the different prevalences of the covariates. STM does this by combining and extending the Correlated Topic Model (CTM), Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression Topic Model (DMR), and the Sparse Additive Generative Topic model into a single one. These underlying themes identified and clustered by the covariates then become the "topics".

## Future Plans for the Project
This was a project I created for a class so I currently do not have more plans to coontinue it. However, it may be something I come back too from time to time to tinker with it.
